## ‚ú® **Skills:**

### Communication, Empathy and Patience
- Always find benefit in interacting and getting to know different people and I always find that putting yourself in someone elses shoes will always provide you with a better perspective, particularly when coding seeing all different types of approaches to problems.
### Creative
- During my learning journey, I have always had a keen eye for creativity, whether that comes with problem-solving or design. I have learnt to adapt in the many ways creativity can be used. During our final makers project working with Google API, to adapt, the data we were handling needed to be converted a certain way and the ability to be creative allowed us to reach our goal.
### Time Management
- During my proffessional career, time management has been a key skill that helped me deliver many projects effeciently. As a Makers graduate, having to learn and produce code within the limited timescales it has only improved my time management skills. I have been able to structure and design programs well.
### Open-mindedness and adaptability
- Having coded prior to Makers Academy I was excited to challenge my skills and be open to learning brand new technologies. For the first few weeks to  learn ruby on rails was a great insight to OOP principles and I was quickly able to adapt and echo my skills onto different projects and technology.
